There are three panels on this app: "Grade" on the left, "See grades" on the top right, and "Email grades" on the bottom left. We used a Gmail to email students grades automatically. By dafault, Google blocks access from less secure app like this. To use our emailing function, turn on the persmission at https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps.
